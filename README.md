## Introduction

SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious SQL code into a query, thereby gaining unauthorized access to a database. This can lead to sensitive data exposure, data manipulation, and even complete server compromise.

This repository aims to provide resources and information to help developers understand and mitigate the risks associated with SQL Injection.

## SQL Injection Basics

SQL Injection attacks can take many forms, but they often involve manipulating input fields such as login forms, search queries, or URL parameters to execute unintended SQL commands. Common techniques used in SQL Injection attacks include:

- Union-based SQL Injection
- Blind SQL Injection
- Error-based SQL Injection
- Time-based SQL Injection

Understanding these basic concepts is crucial for effectively defending against SQL Injection attacks.

## Payloads

In the `payloads.txt` file in this repository, you can find a collection of possible payloads that attackers might use in SQL Injection attacks. These payloads demonstrate various techniques and can be used for testing and educational purposes.

Feel free to contribute additional payloads or improvements to existing ones.

## Prevention Techniques

Preventing SQL Injection requires a combination of secure coding practices and the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements. Some best practices include:

- Using parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input with SQL commands
- Validating and sanitizing user input
- Implementing least privilege principles for database access
- Regularly updating and patching database software

By following these techniques, developers can significantly reduce the risk of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in their applications.
